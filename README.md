"My brave warriors, sons of the soil, today, we stand on the cusp of history. The winds of change are upon us, and it is our duty to seize this moment for the sake of our motherland.

The enemy is vast and powerful, but they do not possess what we have – the love for our land, the fire in our hearts, and the courage in our souls. Remember, we are not fighting for wealth, nor for glory. We fight for Swarajya – our own rule, free from the yoke of foreign tyranny.

Each one of you carries the spirit of Maratha pride within you. The mountains, rivers, and forests of this land know our struggle. The earth beneath our feet is sacred, for it is drenched with the blood of our ancestors who have laid down their lives so that we may breathe the air of freedom.

Do not fear death, for it is a mere step towards immortality. It is said that he who dies for his motherland never truly dies. Your names will be etched in history, and future generations will sing songs of your bravery.

Today, let us unite as one force, one heartbeat, one soul. Let our swords strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. Let our war cry echo across the mountains, and let it be known that the Marathas will not be subdued!

Victory is ours if we remain steadfast, disciplined, and resolute. Together, we will build a kingdom where justice reigns and where every man, woman, and child can live with their heads held high.

Jai Bhavani! Jai Shivaji!"
